"""This is a test module which runs your ???????_veh_rout_func.py code
and reports back the result. There are 10 problems in total.

In order to verify whether or not your code works, place this file,
veh_rout_test.py inside your directory so that it neighbours and can
import from ???????_veh_rout_func.py locally. Then run the code via
conda. If you obtain no errors, this means that for all ten problems,
your code worked.

If you wish to test your own problems as well, you can use
vehicle_router(...) to obtain the result. Use display=True if you wish
to see the problem's solution. If you are happy that your solution is
in fact the optimal solution, then you can use check_vehicle_router(...)
to test the results. Read the function documentation for more
information.
